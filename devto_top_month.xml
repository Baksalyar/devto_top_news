      <description><![CDATA[<p>Eliminating spam has been a massive priority for us at DEV (and the wider Forem ecosystem). If you’ve been with us for a while, you recall that this has been a significant problem in the past. While no platform can claim to be 100% spam-free, the situation is much improved today.</p><p>Our primary goal with these recent updates is simple: get super low-quality content off the platform before a human moderator ever has to deal with it.</p><p>Moderator burnout is real. By automating the removal of the &quot;obvious&quot; junk, we allow our mods to focus on nuanced community interactions rather than deleting hundreds of crypto-scam posts.</p><p>We don’t rely on just one tool. We use a combination of upstream algorithmic detection and &quot;call-outs&quot; to Gemini for independent analysis.</p><p>Algorithmic Upstream Action: If we detect a clear trend—for example, a massive burst of posts linking to a specific spam website—we take action upstream. We prefer to handle these efficiently without needing to query an LLM for every single instance.</p><p>Gemini Analysis: For individual posts that require judgment, we send a custom prompt to Gemini 3. We try to err on the side of &quot;no false positives,&quot; but when the AI detects clear indicators of spam or harmful content, it applies a label that triggers automated workflows.</p><p>To give you a better picture of how this works technically, let&#x27;s look at our ContentModerationLabeler service. This Ruby class is responsible for building the context and asking Gemini to categorize the post.</p><p>We hone these custom prompts over time to ensure accuracy. Here is how we define the assessment criteria within the prompt. We tell Gemini exactly what we are looking for, distinguishing between &quot;Safety,&quot; &quot;Quality,&quot; and &quot;Spam&quot;:</p><p>One key to our success is that we don&#x27;t just send Gemini the text of the article. We also build a User Context .</p><p>A post that looks &quot;okay&quot; might actually be spam if it comes from a brand-new account with zero history. Conversely, a trusted member with badges and years of history gets the benefit of the doubt. We feed these metrics into the prompt so Gemini has the full picture:</p><p>View the ContentModerationLabeler on GitHub</p><p>One interesting observation from our data is regarding the volume of spam. Ironically, the cumulative amount of labeled spam peaked right before we fully integrated these new systems. Spam peak was summer of 2025.</p><p>This happens because deterrence works. As soon as bad actors realize their automated scripts are hitting a wall and their posts are being nuked immediately by our automated systems, they stop wasting resources on our platform.

      <title>Your GitHub Contribution Graph Means Absolutely Nothing - And Here’s Why</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If your GitHub contribution graph disappeared tomorrow, would that make you a worse developer?</p><p>For years, we’ve been trained — consciously or not — to treat green squares as a proxy for competence, discipline, or even passion.</p><p>TL;DR: A GitHub contribution graph measures neither productivity, nor skill, nor engagement as a developer.</p><p>Let me start with two very short stories that inspired me to write this article.</p><p>This discussion was inspired by an article I recently read on DEV.</p><p>The author described how he created an app that automatically commits his code. According to him, he programs a lot, but often simply forgets to commit and push his changes — which makes his GitHub contribution graph look… poor.</p><p>And while I absolutely respect the curiosity, creativity, and the act of turning an idea into a working project, one thought immediately crossed my mind:</p><p>Who on earth evaluates developers based on the number of their commits?</p><p>That makes very little sense.</p><p>Many people in the comments agreed, but some shared stories from job interviews where managers actually asked candidates why their GitHub activity was so low. Even if the answer made perfect sense (for example: most of their work lives in private company repositories) and the interview continued normally, there was still that unpleasant feeling — the candidate was pushed into a defensive position for no good reason.</p><p>Personally, I’ve participated in many recruitment processes and was asked about my GitHub exactly once. But maybe I’m just lucky?</p><p>A few days earlier, a friend from my previous job shared a screenshot of someone’s contribution graph. I’ve modified it here to protect privacy, but it looked roughly like this (The AI stubbornly paints 8 days a week instead of 7 — let&#x27;s keep it that way 🙃):</p><p>Impressive? Maybe. Terrifying? Also maybe.</p><p>My friend — a very empathetic person — didn’t feel admiration at all. Instead, he felt concern.</p><p>Where is the work-life balance? When does this person rest? How does this human being even function?</p><p>The mystery was solved pretty quickly. The graph most likely looked like this because the user had a job that ran a daily database backup .</p><p>For the record: this person actually was very active on GitHub and contributed to many open-source projects — just… not that much.</p><p>And this is where we get to the core of the problem.</p><p>By design, it never should have been.

According to him, he programs a lot, but often simply forgets to commit and push his changes — which makes his GitHub contribution graph look… poor.</p><p>And while I absolutely respect the curiosity, creativity, and the act of turning an idea into a working project, one thought immediately crossed my mind:</p><p>Who on earth evaluates developers based on the number of their commits?</p><p>That makes very little sense.</p><p>Many people in the comments agreed, but some shared stories from job interviews where managers actually asked candidates why their GitHub activity was so low. Even if the answer made perfect sense (for example: most of their work lives in private company repositories) and the interview continued normally, there was still that unpleasant feeling — the candidate was pushed into a defensive position for no good reason.</p><p>Personally, I’ve participated in many recruitment processes and was asked about my GitHub exactly once. But maybe I’m just lucky?</p><p>A few days earlier, a friend from my previous job shared a screenshot of someone’s contribution graph. I’ve modified it here to protect privacy, but it looked roughly like this (The AI stubbornly paints 8 days a week instead of 7 — let&#x27;s keep it that way 🙃):</p><p>Impressive? Maybe. Terrifying? Also maybe.</p><p>My friend — a very empathetic person — didn’t feel admiration at all. Instead, he felt concern.</p><p>Where is the work-life balance? When does this person rest? How does this human being even function?</p><p>The mystery was solved pretty quickly. The graph most likely looked like this because the user had a job that ran a daily database backup .</p><p>For the record: this person actually was very active on GitHub and contributed to many open-source projects — just… not that much.</p><p>And this is where we get to the core of the problem.</p><p>By design, it never should have been. And it doesn’t hold up to even basic common sense.</p><p>And yet, somehow, we still look at it and think:</p><p>Read the rest of the article at the source.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I glanced at my browser tabs this morning. Twenty tabs open. Every single one was either Claude or Gemini.</p><p>Then I remembered what my tabs used to look like just four years ago: Stack Overflow threads, MDN docs, blog posts, GitHub issues. The traditional developer toolkit.</p><p>The shift happened so gradually that I almost missed how fundamental it is.</p><p>Remember the workflow? You&#x27;d hit a problem, craft the perfect search query, wade through Stack Overflow answers from 2014, cross-reference three different blog posts, and eventually piece together a solution. Then you&#x27;d keep those tabs open for days because you might need them again.</p><p>Documentation was your bible. You&#x27;d spend hours reading API docs, trying to understand the examples, mentally mapping them to your specific use case.</p><p>Now? I open a chat. I describe what I&#x27;m building. The conversation unfolds like pair programming with someone who&#x27;s read every piece of documentation and every Stack Overflow thread ever written.</p><p>Need to understand a complex API? Ask questions back and forth until it clicks</p><p>Stuck on an architectural decision? Brainstorm trade-offs in real-time</p><p>Can&#x27;t remember that regex pattern? Get it explained and customized for your exact case</p><p>It&#x27;s not just faster. It&#x27;s fundamentally different.</p><p>Example: Last week I needed to implement rate limiting for my MCP server. Old way: I&#x27;d search &quot;rate limiting node.js&quot;, read 5 articles, piece together a solution, test it, debug it. New way: I described my use case to Claude, we discussed trade-offs (token bucket vs sliding window), it generated an implementation with my specific edge cases handled, I reviewed and shipped.</p><p>Same outcome. Completely different process. The knowledge transfer happened through conversation, not documentation.</p><p>The development community is still processing this shift, and honestly, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re having the right conversations:</p><p>We talk about productivity gains. Sure, I ship faster. But that&#x27;s not the interesting part.</p><p>We don&#x27;t talk enough about how it&#x27;s changing how we learn. I&#x27;m not memorizing syntax anymore. I&#x27;m learning concepts and patterns while the AI handles the implementation details. Is this better? Worse? Just different?</p><p>We&#x27;re not discussing the dependency. My entire workflow now assumes I have access to these tools. What happens when I don&#x27;t? Am I losing skills or just offloading the memorization to focus on higher-level thinking?</p><p>We&#x27;re glossing over what we lost. Those 47 Stack Overflow tabs weren&#x27;t just research - they connected you to the collective knowledge of thousands of developers who struggled with the same problem. Now my tabs are conversations with AI. I&#x27;m more productive, but I&#x27;m also more isolated. There&#x27;s something philosophical there we haven&#x27;t unpacked.</p><p>I love these tools. FPL Hub, the RAG systems I&#x27;ve built, my MCP servers - they&#x27;ve all been developed with AI assistance. I&#x27;m more productive than ever.</p><p>But sometimes I wonder:</p><p>Am I becoming a better developer or just a better prompt engineer?</p><p>Read the rest of the article at the source.</p>]]></description>

Ask questions back and forth until it clicks</p><p>Stuck on an architectural decision? Brainstorm trade-offs in real-time</p><p>Can&#x27;t remember that regex pattern? Get it explained and customized for your exact case</p><p>It&#x27;s not just faster. It&#x27;s fundamentally different.</p><p>Example: Last week I needed to implement rate limiting for my MCP server. Old way: I&#x27;d search &quot;rate limiting node.js&quot;, read 5 articles, piece together a solution, test it, debug it. New way: I described my use case to Claude, we discussed trade-offs (token bucket vs sliding window), it generated an implementation with my specific edge cases handled, I reviewed and shipped.</p><p>Same outcome. Completely different process. The knowledge transfer happened through conversation, not documentation.</p><p>The development community is still processing this shift, and honestly, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re having the right conversations:</p><p>We talk about productivity gains. Sure, I ship faster. But that&#x27;s not the interesting part.</p><p>We don&#x27;t talk enough about how it&#x27;s changing how we learn. I&#x27;m not memorizing syntax anymore. I&#x27;m learning concepts and patterns while the AI handles the implementation details. Is this better? Worse? Just different?</p><p>We&#x27;re not discussing the dependency. My entire workflow now assumes I have access to these tools. What happens when I don&#x27;t? Am I losing skills or just offloading the memorization to focus on higher-level thinking?</p><p>We&#x27;re glossing over what we lost. Those 47 Stack Overflow tabs weren&#x27;t just research - they connected you to the collective knowledge of thousands of developers who struggled with the same problem. Now my tabs are conversations with AI. I&#x27;m more productive, but I&#x27;m also more isolated. There&#x27;s something philosophical there we haven&#x27;t unpacked.</p><p>I love these tools. FPL Hub, the RAG systems I&#x27;ve built, my MCP servers - they&#x27;ve all been developed with AI assistance. I&#x27;m more productive than ever.</p><p>But sometimes I wonder:</p><p>Am I becoming a better developer or just a better prompt engineer?</p><p>Read the rest of the article at the source.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed that many online discussions don&#x27;t really feel like discussions anymore. Instead of exchanging perspectives, we often default to contradiction - not to understand, but to push back.

What I find most disheartening isn’t disagreement itself, but how quickly it turns personal.</p><p>A recent example that stuck with me was the reaction to comments from Sven Vincke at Larian, and the broader discourse around Highguard . What could have been an interesting conversation about creative direction, expectations, and taste quickly hardened into camps. Instead of acknowledging that different players value different things, much of the discussion became about drawing lines and dismissing opposing views outright.</p><p>This isn&#x27;t limited to games, of course. You see the same pattern play out across technical discussions, product debates, and even well-intentioned conversations about tools or methodologies. A suggestion is interpreted as an attack, a preference as a judgment.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One Tuesday morning at 9:14 AM, my six-month-old article got 37 views in 20 minutes. DEV.to&#x27;s dashboard just said &quot;+37 views&quot;. No context. No cause. No pattern.</p><p>I wanted to know why . Was it a comment from someone influential? A share somewhere? A title change from weeks ago finally paying off? The platform couldn&#x27;t tell me. So I decided to steal my own data.</p><p>Not to optimize. Not to perform. But to understand how my articles actually live over time.</p><p>I started with devto-analytics-pro by @gnomeman4201 — a solid foundation for collecting basic metrics. But I wanted more: a temporal vision, a memory that could tell the story of an article over time.</p><p>First step: store everything in a database. Not once, but every 4 to 6 hours. Automatically.</p><p>Why this frequency? Because with daily snapshots, you miss the fine variations. You miss what happens between noon and 6 PM. You smooth everything out. But with this frequency, suddenly, you see the breathing. You see when an article wakes up, when it falls asleep, when something revives it.</p><p>The first thing the data taught me is that I didn&#x27;t know my own articles as well as I thought.</p><p>For example, I discovered that a simple like from an active DEV community member can change everything. Not a spectacular reaction, just a like. But enough for DEV.to to feature the article. And there, the views climb. Not violently, but distinctly. Without regular data tracking, this phenomenon would have completely escaped me.</p><p>I also saw that a title change can triple visibility. Same content, same tags, same structure. Just a reformulated title. And suddenly, the exposure curve takes off again. It&#x27;s not a &quot;shock&quot; — it&#x27;s a lesson. A lesson you can only learn by watching temporal evolution, not by consulting a cumulative total.</p><p>Another discovery: some articles I thought were &quot;dead&quot; continue to bring readers six months after publication. Not many, but regularly. Two views per day, three comments per week. A discreet but real life. Without history, I would never have known they were still breathing.</p><p>And then there are the strange rhythms. My latest article on Cloud Run: 15 views at once on January 11 at 11 AM. Then nothing for 24 hours. Then 10 views on the 13th at 7 AM. Then silence. Then 12 views on the 15th at 11 AM. Then 10 more views on the 17th at 7 AM. Like jerky breathing. Without this collection every 4 hours, I would have only seen a total: &quot;139 views in a week&quot;. With it, I see an article that lives in spurts, waking up at specific moments, then going back to sleep.</p><p>By looking at my own data, I understood things my intuition didn&#x27;t tell me.</p><p>The tool automatically classified my articles into four categories: &quot;Tech Expertise&quot;, &quot;Human &amp; Career&quot;, &quot;Culture &amp; Agile&quot;, and &quot;Free Exploration&quot;. I didn&#x27;t choose these categories — the content analysis made them emerge.</p><p>And there, surprise:</p><p>My &quot;Free Exploration&quot; articles — the freest, most personal ones — generate almost three times more engagement than technical pieces. These texts only reach 211 people on average, but these 211 people react, comment, discuss.</p><p>Respiration , for example: 460 views, 8.7% engagement. An article about burnout, writing, breathing. Nothing technical. Just a personal reflection. And it&#x27;s the one that creates the most conversation.</p><p>My &quot;Culture &amp; Agile&quot; articles bring more visibility: 819 views on average, but only 2.5% engagement. Actually Agile: Against Performance Theater : 2154 views, 4% engagement. It reaches many people, but engagement is shallower.</p><p>A revealing detail: &quot;Actually Agile&quot; generated 29 comments over 33 days. &quot;Respiration&quot; generated 10 comments over 3 days. The first created a conversation that stretched over time. The second created a concentrated explosion, then silence. Two types of engagement, two different rhythms.</p><p>So I wrote three more &quot;Free Exploration&quot; pieces the following month.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, I lived with a constant, low-level hum of guilt. ​You know the feeling. It’s Saturday morning. You are drinking coffee, maybe about to go for a walk or play a video game. But in the back of your mind, a little voice is whispering:</p><p>​&quot;You should be working on that React Native side project.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have you tried out Bun yet? Everyone on X is talking about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Real developers code for fun.&quot;</p><p>​The tech industry has sold us a lie: That passion equals hours logged.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, I lived with a constant, low-level hum of guilt. ​You know the feeling. It’s Saturday morning.
