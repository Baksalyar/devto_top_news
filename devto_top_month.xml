      <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed that many online discussions don&#x27;t really feel like discussions anymore. Instead of exchanging perspectives, we often default to contradiction - not to understand, but to push back.

What I find most disheartening isn’t disagreement itself, but how quickly it turns personal.</p><p>A recent example that stuck with me was the reaction to comments from Sven Vincke at Larian, and the broader discourse around Highguard . What could have been an interesting conversation about creative direction, expectations, and taste quickly hardened into camps. Instead of acknowledging that different players value different things, much of the discussion became about drawing lines and dismissing opposing views outright.</p><p>This isn&#x27;t limited to games, of course.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ll admit it — sometimes I like publishing a post on the weekend, when both the internet and real life slow down a bit. But weekends are not the time for heavy technical or philosophical deep dives. It’s better to go for something lighter.</p><p>I spent a while looking for the right format. Topics like “the funniest commits ever” are fun, sure — but how many times can you do that?</p><p>And then it clicked.
